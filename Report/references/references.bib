abstract = "Recommender systems are used to recommend potentially interesting items to users in different domains. Nowadays, there is a wide range of domains in which there is a need to offer recommendations to group of users instead of individual users. As a consequence, there is also a need to address the preferences of individual members of a group of users so as to provide suggestions for groups as a whole. Group recommender systems present a whole set of new challenges within the field of recommender systems. In this article, we present two expert recommender systems that suggest entertainment to groups of users. These systems, jMusicGroupRecommender and jMoviesGroupRecommender, suggest music and movies and utilize different methods for the generation of group recommendations: merging recommendations made for individuals, aggregation of individualsâ€™ ratings, and construction of group preference models. We also describe the results obtained when comparing different group recommendation techniques in both domains. "

title="Group Modeling: Selecting a Sequence of Television Items to Suit a Group of Viewers",
journal="User Modeling and User-Adapted Interaction",
year="2004",
volume="14",
number="1",
pages="37--85",
abstract="Watching television tends to be a social activity. So, adaptive television needs to adapt to groups of users rather than to individual users. In this paper, we discuss different strategies for combining individual user models to adapt to groups, some of which are inspired by Social Choice Theory. In a first experiment, we explore how humans select a sequence of items for a group to watch, based on data about the individuals' preferences. The results show that humans use some of the strategies such as the Average Strategy (a.k.a. Additive Utilitarian), the Average Without Misery Strategy and the Least Misery Strategy, and care about fairness and avoiding individual misery. In a second experiment, we investigate how satisfied people believe they would be with sequences chosen by different strategies, and how their satisfaction corresponds with that predicted by a number of satisfaction functions. The results show that subjects use normalization, deduct misery, and use the ratings in a non-linear way. One of the satisfaction functions produced reasonable, though not completely correct predictions. According to our subjects, the sequences produced by five strategies give satisfaction to all individuals in the group. The results also show that subjects put more emphasis than expected on showing the best rated item to each individual (at a cost of misery for another individual), and that the ratings of the first and last items in the sequence are especially important. In a final experiment, we explore the influence viewing an item can have on the ratings of other items. This is important for deciding the order in which to present items. The results show an effect of both mood and topical relatedness.",

abstract="While the problem of building recommender systems has attracted considerableattention in recent years, most recommender systems are designed for recommendingitems to individuals. The aim of this paper is to automatically recommenda ranked list of new items to a group of users. We will investigate the value of usingBayesian networks to represent the different uncertainties involved in a group recommendingprocess, i.e. those uncertainties related to mechanisms that govern theinteractions between group members and the processes leading to the final choice orrecommendation. We will also show how the most common aggregation strategiesmight be encoded using a Bayesian network formalism. The proposed model can beconsidered as a collaborative Bayesian network-based group recommender system,where group ratings are computed from the past voting patterns of other users withsimilar tastes.",

    abstract = " This paper examines the effect of recommender systems on the diversity of sales. Two anecdotal views exist about such effects. Some believe recommenders help consumers discover new products and thus increase sales diversity. Others believe recommenders only reinforce the popularity of already-popular products. This paper seeks to reconcile these seemingly incompatible views. We explore the question in two ways. First, modeling recommender systems analytically allows us to explore their path-dependent effects. Second, turning to simulation, we increase the realism of our results by combining choice models with actual implementations of recommender systems. We arrive at three main results. First, some well-known recommenders can lead to a reduction in sales diversity. Because common recommenders (e.g., collaborative filters) recommend products based on sales and ratings, they cannot recommend products with limited historical data, even if they would be rated favorably. In turn, these recommenders can create a rich-get-richer effect for popular products and vice versa for unpopular ones. This bias toward popularity can prevent what may otherwise be better consumer-product matches. That diversity can decrease is surprising to consumers who express that recommendations have helped them discover new products. In line with this, result two shows that it is possible for individual-level diversity to increase but aggregate diversity to decrease. Recommenders can push each person to new products, but they often push users toward the same products. Third, we show how basic design choices affect the outcome, and thus managers can choose recommender designs that are more consistent with their sales goals and consumers' preferences. "
