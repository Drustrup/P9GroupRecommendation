Group recommendation, while plagued by the inability to obtain an optimal satisfaction for all members, is still improvable. In this report group recommendation is explored with the help of techniques from the information retrieval area and group decision making methods aside from the classic aggregations. From information retrieval we find the methods of rank aggregation and normalized discounted cumulative gain(nDCG). nDCG is used as a satisfaction measure for both the individual group members and the group as a whole. From voting systems the method of Single Transferable Vote is extracted as a decision strategy. These approaches are combined to form what we dubbed Borda Transferable Count, a method that our preliminary tests show to give the group about 12\% more satisfaction than the classic rank aggregation method of Borda Count.
