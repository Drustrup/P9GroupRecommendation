Group recommendation, while plagued by the inability to obtain an optimal satisfaction for all members, is still improvable. In this report the group recommendations are based on rank aggregation, mainly Borda Count, and voting systems, in the form of Single Transferable Vote. These new approaches are combined to form what we dubbed Borda Transferable Count, a method that our preliminary tests show to give the group about 12\% more satisfaction than the classic rank aggregation method of Borda.
