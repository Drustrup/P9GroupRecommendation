\chapter*{Preface}
Before reading this report, it is advised that the reader has a basic understanding of what a recommender system is. Furthermore, understanding content based and collaborative filtering based recommendations is helpful, but not necessary for the sake of this report, however several of the articles referenced to throughout the report assume that the reader knows these concepts. If the reader wishes to study these concepts, the authors recommend reading the relevant sections from "Recommender Systems Handbook"\cite{recsyshandbook}.

Throughout the report the authors will refer to themselves through the use of the words, we and our, for the sake of convenience. Additionally, some words and concepts will be abbreviated throughout the report, in these cases the first time the abbreviation is made, it will be presented in parenthesizes, for instance matrix factorization(MF).
