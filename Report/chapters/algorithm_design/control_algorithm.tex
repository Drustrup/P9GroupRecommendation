\section{Control Algorithm}

In order to verify that the recommendation algorithm is implemented correctly we make a control algorithm. In al simplicity this algorithm is just making use of the average aggregation method described in \todo{ref to avg aggregation here}. 

The reason that we to do this, is that we manually, and relatively easy, can calculate the results ourselves. By doing so, we can make sure the both the aggregate and the recommend algorithm works as intended. 

Besides for control, we would like to use this algorithm as our baseline and our aim is to perform better than the average aggregation.
