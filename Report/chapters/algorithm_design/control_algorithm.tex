\section{Control Aggregations} \todo{Needs to be updated}

Implementing and testing the aggregation methods described in Section \ref{sec:novelaggregationmethods}, would not provide any useful data on its own. Therefore a two aggregation methods will be used as a measuring baseline. The first will be Borda Count(BC) that will represent a solid comparison baseline, since the new methods being tested are modifications of BC, while the second will be a random selection method. If the new methods can not, on average, outperform a random selection, then there would be no reason to use the method at all.
