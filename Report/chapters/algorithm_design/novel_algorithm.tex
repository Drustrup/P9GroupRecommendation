\section{Novel Aggregation Emphasizing Reasoning}
\todo{Change name of section, preferably to something with a catchy acronym}
Encompassing the findings in Section \ref{bg:aggregation:groupbehavior}, we construct our own novel approach to the selection process in a group recommender. The approach is intended to put emphasis on the ratings from group members that like the tracks the most. This will be accomplished by using the multiplicative aggregation strategy on a small number of the highest ratings , while the remaining ratings are handled with the average strategy.

With this approach we hope to increase the overall satisfaction of the group by projecting the predicted satisfaction of those with the highest ratings for an item onto the rest of the group. We are disregarding accounting specifically for misery and dissatisfaction as it was discovered in \cite{d} \todo{Add citation to the article/study used in aggregation section} that such strategies performed poorly.

A step by step guide to the aggregation would be as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For each item, split the ratings from the group members into one of two sets
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Set 1 with the highest x ratings
		\item Set 2 with the rest of the ratings
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Find the average of the ratings in set 2, and add that average to set 1
	\item Multiply all the ratings in set 1 with each-other to get the score for the item
\end{enumerate}

The randomized ratings presented in Table \ref{tbl:randomdatasample}, are used to perform the aggregation strategy and the result hereof is seen in Table \ref{tbl:topheavyaggregation}. A higher score is better, which means that in the example item T2 would be chosen. There is nothing preventing the method from being used to select a sequence of items instead of just one.
