\section{Satisfaction Results} \todo{Rename section}

To test how the implemented methods performed compared to each other, the setup from Section \ref{} \todo{insert reference to test setup} was used. Be aware that th scales of the figures differ a bit due to the random selection performing much worse than the other approaches thus dragging the lower end of the scale down.

Figure \ref{fig:testresult4members} presents the average satisfaction when the groups consists of 4 random members. Here there is only little difference in the fond satisfaction with Borda Escalated Count edging out slightly ahead, being a little less than 1\% better than Borda Count. Borda Transferable Count and Borda Weighted Count are both minimally worse than BC, but as both the methods are more reliant on items being present in multiple top-k lists amongst the users, it is no surprise that they give worse results than BC.

Already when the group size is increased to 8, Figure \ref{fig:testresult8members}, a trend of BTC outperforming the other methods starts emerging, and at 8 members it outperforms BC by about 1.5\%. An interesting thing to note is that there is a generally sharp dropoff in satisfaction for all methods when going from 4 to 8 members, but as the group size is increased further, all but BTC drops further, while BTC maintains a satisfaction of around 0.59 until the group size is increased to 40.

BTC ability to satisfy larger groups becomes truly apparent with a group size of 12 and 16, Figure \ref{fig:testresult12members} and Figure \ref{fig:testresult16members}, where it is about 6.3\% and 10.7\% better respectively. BC, BWC, and BEC all perform within 1\% of each other, with BEC performing slightly worse than the other two.

When the group size reaches 20, Figure \ref{fig:testresult20members}, BTC also outperforms the other methods the most, at least with the group sizes tested. On average it outperforms BC with 12.2\%. However after size 20, the benefits of BTC seems to gradually fall away, as Figure \ref{fig:testresult40members} shows, at a group size of 40 BTC has had a larger drop in satisfaction than the other methods
