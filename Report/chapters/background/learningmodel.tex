\section{Learning Model}
While there are several different learning models, we have chosen to focus on a few of them, SVD, SVD++, and non-negative matrix factorization. Specifically we have chosen to look at these because of their offline training capabilities, which is helpful when we have to test multiple different aggregations at a later stage.
