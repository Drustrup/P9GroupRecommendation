\section{Learning Model}
While there are several different learning models, we have chosen to focus on a few of them, which are SVD, SVD++, and non-negative matrix factorization(NMF). Specifically we have chosen to look at these because of their offline training capabilities, which are helpful when we have to test multiple different aggregations at a later stage.
