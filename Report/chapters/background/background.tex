\chapter{Background}\label{background}

This chapter describes the theories and knowledge that is used throughout the project. Starting with learning models, with focus on the matrix factorization method of SVD and variations hereof. Then we describe a elements of data preprocessing, testing, and evaluation methods, before the group decision making substitute of aggregation is described and analyzed.
