\chapter{Background}

This chapter describes the theories and knowledge that is used throughout the project. Starting with learning models, with focus on the matrix factorization method of singular value decomposition(SVD) and variations hereof. Then we describe elements of data preprocessing, testing, and evaluation methods, before the substitute for group decision making by aggregation is described and analyzed. As part of the aggregations we also look at the voting system of single transferable vote.
