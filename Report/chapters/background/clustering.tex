\section{Clustering}\label{bg:clustering}
Clustering as a widely used method when working with a large amount or data. In short it is about grouping similar data in ``clusters''. In the domain of recommending clustering is commonly used together with recommendation method called collaborative filtering, where the data is clustered into users with similar ratings for given items. The user data in these clusters are then used to make individual recommendations to the users.

One of the most efficient collaborative filtering methods which uses clustering is matrix factorization, described in \sectionref{bg:matrixfactorization}. 

Looking at the dataset we get when we have to make group recommendations it is rather small compared to what is use in normal group recommenders.

Although using clustering in general give some good results, clustering when recommending to groups is not the most suitable solution.



%When using clustering for recommendation systems typically they are used in collaborative filtering to find users with similar interests and predict new items based on users in the same clusters.
