\section{Matrix Factorization} \label{bg:matrixfactorization}
Function
Decomposing the rating matrix/Latent Semantic Indexing
Approximating a matrix of ratings
Users, u x Items, i, matrix R of rank n, approximated to two matrices of P, of size u x k, and Q, of size i x k, with k < n.
k is the dimensional latent space.
Performance
Faster than both. Scales better.
"for x<0.5 SVD-based prediction is
better than the CF-Predict predictions. For x>0.5,
however, the CF-Predict predictions are slightly
better. This suggests that nearest-neighbor based
collaborative filtering algorithms are susceptible to
data sparsity as the neighborhood formation process
is hindered by the lack of enough training data. On
the other hand, SVD based prediction algorithms can
overcome the sparsity problem by utilizing the latent
relationships. However, as the training data is
increased both SVD and CF-Predict prediction
quality improve but the improvement in case of CFPredict
surpasses the SVD improvement"
Performance vs other techniques (pearson and cosine, describe other techniques)
Scales better than nearest neighbor since our matrices are approximated (smaller)
As noted in the 2011 SysRec book - neighborhood methods have 2 flaws: Limited coverage, Sensitivity to sparse data. MF counteracts this via approximation and dimensionality reduction.
Cosine Similarity > Pearson Correlation (Collaborative Filtering Recommender Systems by Michael D. Ekstrand)
Reduced coverage makes pearson/cosine nearest neighbor weak (source 2000)
\subsection{Collective Matrix Factorization}
Problem/specialcase introducing necessity of extension
"Collective matrix factorization is a very general technique
for revealing low-rank representations for arbitrary
matrix collections. However, the practical applicability
of earlier solutions has been limited since
they implicitly assume all factors to be relevant for all
matrices" (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.5921v2.pdf)
Function
MF is single-view
Multi-view are many matrices
Augmented Multi-view is CMF
