\chapter{Introduction} 
Throughout time recommendations have often been a determined factor in decision making.
The first recommendations were word-of-mouth recommendations where family and friends would proclaim their opinion about certain products like movies, books, or travelling destinations. 

In the past decades the way we receive these recommendations have changed a lot. Today recommendations often occur online and there exist a recommender for almost every item or service available. The difference between these recommenders compared to word-of-mouth is that they are based on either what other people similar to you like or based on items similar to those associated with you, respectively collaborative or content-based recommendations.

Even though recommenders is a big part of our everyday lives, there are some situations where there is a shortage in the recommender field. One of these shortcomings is group recommendation, like having a group of people deciding where to go on vacation, which movie to watch, or what music to hear. Some research have been done in the filed, but no method have yet been able to reflect the decision making process of a group. In this report we look into the problem of recommending to groups in order to obtain an acceptable level of satisfaction in the group.
