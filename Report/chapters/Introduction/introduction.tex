\chapter{Introduction} 
Throughout time recommendations of any sort have always been a determined factor in many outcomes.
The first recommendations were word-of-mouth recommendations where family and friends tell about their opinion about for example a movies, books, or travelling destinations, whereas in the past decades the way we receive these recommendations have changed a lot.

Today there are digital recommenders for almost every item or service available. The difference between these recommenders compared to word-of-mouth is that they are based on either what other people similar to you like or based on items similar to those associated with you, respectively collaborative or content based recommendations.

Even though recommenders are rather common, little work has been done in regards to making recommendations suitable for a group of people. This report is about how to make group recommendations and how to determine if the group is satisfied with the items that is recommended.
