\section{Problem Statement}
The purpose of recommending differs depending on the type of domain. Looking at music recommendation for individuals, the main purpose of the recommendation is to recommend new music the individual would like while at the same time not just recommending the currently most popular songs. This purpose changes if we want to recommend music to groups, a group by our definition is 4 people or more. Instead of finding new music, the focus is on satisfying every person in the group to some extent, which does not necessarily require avoiding the popularity bias. 

This though raises the question of how to measure the satisfaction level in a group of people based on the satisfaction of each persons opinion of the music played. This leads us to the question:
\textit{How can recommendations be made to a group of people by reflecting a groups decision making process, to ensuring a high level of satisfaction in the group?} This statement opens for questions like:
\begin{itemize}
\item How to make recommendations to a group of people based on the users' individual preferences?
\item How to measure the level of satisfaction in a group in regards to the music recommended?
\item How to reflect group decisions algorithmically while securing satisfaction for the individuals as well as the group as a whole?
\end{itemize}
