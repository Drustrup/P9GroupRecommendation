\section{Scenarios}

\subsection{Group Movie watching}
Size: 3-6
Group needs to decide on a movie to watch. They are able discuss it among themselves. The people do not necessarily know each other, but they are likely friends or acquaintances.
\subsection{Gathering with Music}
size: 3-6
Group needs to decide on the sequence of music playing. There are few enough that a sort of consensus could be reached via dialog. All within hearing distance of each other. The people do not necessarily know each other, but they are likely friends or acquaintances.
\subsection{Party with Music}
size: 20-100
Group needs to decide on the sequence of music playing. They are able to communicate, however from the size and context of the event, it is impractical as the focus is elsewhere for most people to quickly reach a consensus. There are likely clusters of friends, however the group is more randomly put together.
