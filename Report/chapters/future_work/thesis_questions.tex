\section{Thesis Questions}
Throughout the work done during this project, we have encountered or discovered a number of hurdles, possible improvements, and new approaches. These findings should be studied further and we will in our next project look into the following areas:

% Lack of dataset with focus on groups
% Re-ranking the top-k based on the average of the rest of the group
% Application of other existing datasets
