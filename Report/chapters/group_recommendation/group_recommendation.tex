\chapter{Group Recommendation} \label{group_recommendation}
In this chapter we will describe the implementation setup. We start by shortly describing the choice of dataset and the preprocessing thereof. Then we move on to the implementation SVD, which arguably also can be categorized as a preprocessing step. Next we describe, how we extract the users ranked lists from the prediction matrix, we get from SVD. Then we show how we have implemented the aggregation algorithms described in the previous chapter. Lastly, we have a small discussion regarding the implementation.
