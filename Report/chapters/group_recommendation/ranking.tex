\section{Ranking}\label{sec:ranking}
Prior to making a group recommendation, we needed to know each member of the groups favorite items in a ranked order. This is why we made the individual recommendations earlier. A ranked list for a user consists of their highest rated movies by descending order. We get the movies from the recommendation matrix where we select a users top 10. It is an arbitrary number, but it is a common standard in the recommendation field, so we choose it as well, but for future convenience it can be changed.

\note{maybe this should be in the future work section (I agree, Claus)}
As of now we only rank by ratings in descending order, but we have a theory that using another sorting method rather than the users individual preferences, it could be possible to enhance the satisfaction of the group. One idea could be ranking the users' top 10 by a movie's average rating instead of just that user's ratings.
