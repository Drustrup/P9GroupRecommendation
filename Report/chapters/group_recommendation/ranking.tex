\section{Ranking}\label{sec:ranking}
Prior to making a group recommendation, we need to know each member of the groups favourite items in a ranked order. This is why we made the individual recommendations earlier. A ranked list for a user consists of its highest rated movies ordered by descending. We get the movies from the recommendation matrix where we select a users top 10. It is an arbitrary number, but it is a common standard in the recommendation field, so we choose it as well, but for future convenience it can be changed. 

\note{maybe this should be in the future work section}
As of now we only rank by ratings in descending order, but we have a theory that using another sorting method rather than the users individual preferences it could be possible to enhance the satisfaction of the group. One idea could be ranking i users' top 10 by a movie's average rating instead of just of a user's ratings.
