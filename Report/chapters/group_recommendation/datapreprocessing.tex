\section{Data Processing}\label{sec:data_preprocessing}
For this project we were using the Movielens 100k data set which contain 100.000 ratings, between 1 and 5, from 943 users spread out on 1682 movies\cite{movielens100k}. 
We also looked at a dataset from last.fm called 1K\cite{lastfmdataset}, it but we decided to use the Movielens set because it came with a 5-fold test setup which saved us for some processing work.

In order for us to use the data for matrix factorization we need to present it in a matrix. We constructed 6 different $User \times Movies$ matrices. One for each of the folds containing the 80000 ratings to be trained on and a matrix containing all the ratings.
