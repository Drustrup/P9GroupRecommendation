\section{Data Processing}\label{sec:data_preprocessing}
For this project we were using the Movielens 100k data set, which contains 100.000 ratings, between 1 and 5, from 943 users spread out on 1682 movies\cite{movielens100k}. 
We also looked at a dataset from last.fm called 1K\cite{lastfmdataset}, but we decided to use the Movielens set because it came prepackaged with a 5-fold test setup, which saved us some processing work.

In order for us to use the data for matrix factorization we needed to present it in a matrix. We constructed 6 different $User \times Movies$ matrices. One for each of the folds containing the 80000 ratings to be trained on and a matrix with all the ratings.
