\section{Data Processing}\label{sec:data_preprocessing}
For this project we are using the Movielens 100k data set which contains 100000 ratings, between 1 and 5, from 943 user spread out on 1682 movies\cite{movielens100k}. 

Notes:
The data set was separated into 5 folds
\subsection{Preprocessing}
In order to use the data set for matrix factorization we need to present it in a matrix. 

Notes: 
Extract different users and movies.
Constructing matrices of the folds and the total data set.
Making new base folds containing all items
