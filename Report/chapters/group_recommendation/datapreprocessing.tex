\section{Data Processing}\label{sec:data_preprocessing}
For this project we were using the MovieLens 100k data set, which contains 100.000 ratings, between 1 and 5, from 943 users spread out on 1682 movies\cite{movielens100k}. 
We also looked at a dataset from last.fm called 1K\cite{lastfmdataset}, but we decided to use the MovieLens set because it came prepackaged with a 5-fold test setup, which saved us some processing work. We do this as it is easier for testing purposes, as it will still be applicable for the scenario given in Section \ref{sec:introduction_scenario}, if given a proper dataset for the domain to train with.

In order for us to use the data for SVD we needed to present it in a matrix. We constructed 6 different $Users \times Movies$ matrices. One for each of the folds for both training and testing containing the 80000 ratings and 20000 ratings respectively and a matrix with all the ratings.
