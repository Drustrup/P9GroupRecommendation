In this paper we worked on the problem of recommending items to a group of people based on the preferences of the individual users. We approached this problem as a rank aggregation problem and focused on the top-k preferences of the users.
The methods used for the aggregations were Borda Count, Markov Chain, Spearman's Footrule, and Average.

One of our primary goals were to present a testing setup to give a satisfying theoretical conclusion on which aggregation method to use. For the setup we used Borda Count and Markov Chain showed promising results, but Borda Count was the best performing method.
