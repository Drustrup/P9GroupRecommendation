In this paper we worked on the problem of recommending items to a group of people based on the preferences of the individual users. We decided to approach the problem as that for rank aggregation and only focus on the top-k of the users preferences. 
The main question we wanted to answer was which rank aggregation method that preforms best. In order to answer this we needed a test setup 

The aggregation methods we tested were Borda Count, Markov Chain, Spearman's Footrule, and Average. 


% We approached this problem as a  problem and focused on the top-k preferences of the users. The methods used for the aggregations were Borda Count, Markov Chain, Spearman's Footrule, and Average.

%One of our primary goals were to present a testing setup to give a satisfying theoretical conclusion on which aggregation method to use. For the setup we used Borda Count and Markov Chain showed promising results, but Borda Count was the best performing method.
