\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}

In this section we show our evaluation of the aggregation methods described in Section \ref{sec:aggregations}. Each method is tested according to four measures, two of which are theoretical satisfaction scores and the other the distance measures.
\note{Make setup section where we argue the setup of our tests, e.g. value of k, our ranking measures, and t-test}
