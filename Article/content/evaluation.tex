\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
In this section we show our evaluation of the aggregation methods described in Section \ref{sec:aggregations}. The aim of the evaluation was finding an appropriate aggregation strategy for group recommender systems according to the 4 measures. Second to that was to confirm earlier findings on group recommender systems and extend them to other measures and bigger group sizes.
