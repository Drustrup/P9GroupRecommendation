\subsection{Ranking}
Ranking is the idea of the position of an item in a ranked list is important. This means that if there is a list of ratings $\tau$ the list is ranked if $\tau (1) > \tau (2) > ... > \tau (k)$

When we talk about a top-k list in this paper we are referring to an ranked list of user preferences which is ordered by their item ratings in descending order.

There are several reasons for the use of ranked lists. 
The first reason is that we want to return a ranked list as a result of the aggregation because we want to ease the decision making without taking the decision. 
Secondly, there are a good selection of measurements for the quality of a ranked list. Many of these measures takes two lists, $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$, which are both ranked lists of the same size. 

In our case one of the lists is a top-k list and the second list is the ranked list of recommendations.
