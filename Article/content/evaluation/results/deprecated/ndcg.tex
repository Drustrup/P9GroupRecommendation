\adparagraph{nDCG}
Figure \ref{fig:ndcg} shows the nDCG score for BC, MC, SF, and Avg. With nDCG a higher score is better as covered in Section \ref{sec:methodology_ndcg}.
BC and MC gets the best results, but they all follow the same general trend with a sharp decrease in score that quickly levels out.

One outlying case SF starts out close to Avg for a group size of four, but decreases much less in score and is closer to BC and MC as the size increases.
