\adparagraph{nDCG}
Figure \ref{fig:ndcg} shows the nDCG score for BC, \MC, SF, and Avg. For nDCG a higher score is better as covered in Section \ref{sec:methodology_ndcg}.\note{this is not explicitly covered in that section}
All methods see a sharp drop off in the quality of their recommendations as the group sizes increase.
As shown in Table \ref{tbl:ndcg}, BC drops the most in the jump from 4 to 8 group members, however it also have the best results, and outperforms all other methods across all group sizes.
\MC is second best by only a few percentage points and follows the same trend and quickly plateaus in score.
One outlying case SF starts out close to Avg for a group size of four, but retains a higher score and is closer to BC and \MC as the size increases.
Avg is the worst performing overall.
