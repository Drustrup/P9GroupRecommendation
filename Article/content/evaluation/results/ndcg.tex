\adparagraph{nDCG}
Figure \ref{fig:ndcg} shows the nDCG score for BC, MC, SF, and Avg. For nDCG a higher score is better as covered in Section \ref{sec:methodology_ndcg}.
All methods see a sharp drop off in the quality of their recommendations as the group sizes increase.
BC drops the most in the jump from 4 to 8 group members, however it also have the best results, and outperforms all other methods across all group sizes.
MC is second best by only a few percentage points and follows the same trend and quickly plateaus in score.
One outlying case SF starts out close to Avg for a group size of four, but retains a higher score and is closer to BC and MC as the size increases.
Avg is the worst performing.
