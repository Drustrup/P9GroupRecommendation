\subsection{Setup}\label{sec:setup}
\note{make introduction}
Throughout these tests we have decided to assign $k$ the size 10. In Figure \ref{fig:setup}, we see how the lists of individual recommendations for a group of size $u$ will be put through an aggregation method before outputting a list of k ranked items.

%\subsubsection{Ranking Measures}
%To measure our rankings, we use nDCG, Rating nDCG, KTD and SFD, each covered in Section \ref{sec:ranking}. The way we are going to present the results of these tests are by finding an average score for each group. With that we find the average for all the groups, and that is the returned value for the measure.
