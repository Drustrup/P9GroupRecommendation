\subsection{T-test}
We made paired t-tests for all methods. Each method is compared with each other methods with the results of each measure. For each, the t-test will output a p-value, which is a number between 0 and 1 for the percentage chance that the difference between two sets of results is coincidental. At $0.05$ or lower, it's considered that there is statistically significant difference in the means of the two sets.
