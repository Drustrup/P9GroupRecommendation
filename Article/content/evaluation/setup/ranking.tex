\subsubsection{Satisfaction Measures}\label{sec:satisfactionmeasures}
We measure the groups' satisfaction of a recommended list, $\omega$, according to Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain(nDCG). We used two different variations which are described in this section. nDCG is used for measuring the quality of ranked lists against user preferences, which is commonly used within the information retrieval field for comparing ranked lists of queries\cite{ndcg}.
