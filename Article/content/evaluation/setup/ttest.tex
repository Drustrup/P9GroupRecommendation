\subsubsection{T-test}\label{sec:ttest}
We made paired t-tests for all methods. Each method is compared with each of the other methods for all measures. The t-test outputs a p-value, which is the probability that the difference between two sets of results is coincidental. At $0.05$ or lower, it is considered that there is statistically significant difference in the means of the two sets.\note{Citation}
