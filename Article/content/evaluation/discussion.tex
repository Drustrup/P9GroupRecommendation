%All methods saw similar decreases in effectiveness across group sizes.

%BC performed best for nDCG. Other benefits include fast computation time, simple to implement. Outperforms or stands equal to various extensions we've developed. Compared with MC for nDCG, the mean difference is small, but consistent.

%MC performed 2nd best for nDCG. Our implementation is very slow, but it can be optimized a lot (probably still not faster than BC). No indication in data, but might surprise for bigger topK lists, which in turn raises the connectivity (main strength). Runs on the Copeland method, which is ill regarded for aggregation, but works reasonably well here.

%Avg generally performs poorly. It gets some good results in Adjusted nDCG, but that is a measurement uniquely advantageous for it among the methods, so it makes little sense as a measure.
