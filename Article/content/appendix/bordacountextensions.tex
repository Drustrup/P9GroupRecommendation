\section{Borda Count Extensions}
In this section we will comment on some extensions for BC called Borda Weighted Count(BWC), Borda Transferable Count(BTC), and Borda Escalating Count(BEC) which were made during last semesters work and show promising results at that time\cite{ourreport}. 

Unfortunately an unwanted feature was present in during the original nDCG test in the earlier work and after seeing the results of the preliminary tests for this paper we decide to drop the extensions for now. 

Looking at the results in the Figures \ref{fig:appendixndcg}, \ref{fig:appenixrndcg}, \ref{fig:appendixkendall}, and \ref{fig:appendixspearman} it is clear to see that BC on most cases performs best or equal to the other approaches though worth noting is that BWC performs almost equal to BC in most cases and even slightly better in a few cases. These results shows that there still could be made possible improvements on BC.

For a further explanation of the BC extensions we reference to our technical report\cite{ourreport}.
