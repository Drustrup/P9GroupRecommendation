\subsection{Average}\label{sec:average}
As a control algorithm we choose Average(Avg) aggregation as it is one of the more common used and well performing methods within group recommendation.\note{cite} The implementation we have done does only work with the items in the top-k list. It finds the union of all the users $u\in U$ lists so $\tau_1 \cup ... \cup \tau_u = S$. The Avg method then uses the full lists from the individual recommendations to find the average rating for the items in $S$.
