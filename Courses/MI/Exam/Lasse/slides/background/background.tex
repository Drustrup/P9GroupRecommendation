\frametitle{Roles}
Roles are a method us to analyse networks
\begin{itemize}
\item Graph similarity 
\item Network modelling 
\item Visualization 
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Problem of Roles}
\begin{itemize}
\item Roles are network-specific giving it limited comparative options with other networks with another set of roles
\item In dynamic networks it is possible for roles to change or disappear over time
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\frametitle{The Goal of the Article}
The purpose of this paper is to present a novel method that uses features based on interaction patterns and structural positions of a users to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Find roles independent of dataset
\item Find roles that persists over time
\end{itemize}
This method should utilize the latent factors to identify the feature structure of the roles.

\note{
What is the article trying to do\\
Persistent roles consisting over time and datasets based on features.
