\subsection{Classification}
Classification is a learning model concerned with mapping objects to categories which could, as an example, be Like/Dislike or on a rating scale from 1-5. Classification is normally used in the supervised learning domain as labeled data is required. Labeled data is a data where every feature is known also the categories. This data is needed in order to train the classifier, classifier being the algorithm enforcing classification. 

In general a classifier takes the features belonging to a certain category and uses these to generate a prediction measure. The idea is that when the classifier is given an object with an unknown category, it can by looking at the remaining known features calculate a probability score for each category, based on the empirical information collected from the training data and thereby classify it. Some of the most used classifiers are Nearest Neighbours, Decision trees or Bayesian Classifier. \todo{add sources}
