\frametitle{Conclusion}
This paper presents a feature-based methodology which identify six different roles that are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Persistent throughout the timespan of the datasets
	\item Independently derived from different datasets
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Shortcomings}
\begin{itemize}
\item The authors does not argue for their selection of features or give a reference to an article that does.
\item I would have appreciated some more examples or are more detailed description of some of their approaches.
\item The distribution of snapshots are not consistent.
\end{itemize}
